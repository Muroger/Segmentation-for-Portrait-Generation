# Image Segmentation for Plant Phenotyping

## Introduction

Goal: Recognise plant leaves from live images and determine plant size and additionally, growth rate. 

This repo contains 2 main technologies for image segmentation:
1. Color thresholding 
2. Deep learning

## Installation

`pip install -r requirements.txt `

## Quick Run
### Color Thresholding

You can run `python color_segmentation_image.py` if you are using photos, or `python color_segmentation_webcam.py` if you want to use your webcam for live feed instead. 

The codes for deep-learning based image segmentation is WIP.
